# Cryptocurrencies

The goal of this analyis was to group cryptocurrencies based on several core haracteristics. First I preprocessed the crypto dataset. Then I used PCA to reduce the dataset to three factors. Next I created an elbow curve and determined that I would use four clusters for my K-Means alfgorithm. To finish off, I performed the K-Means algorithm and created several visualizations to display my results.
